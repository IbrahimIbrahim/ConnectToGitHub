Generating RSA Keys Locally (i.e., the client)
----------------------------------------------
1) Type in the command line:
      $ mkdir ~/.ssh
      $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
      $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    # Creates a directort for RSA Keys.

      $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    # Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

2) Enter the name of the directory you are creating (i.e., mylocalgit).

3) Enter the passphrase when prompted.
    # This passphrase will protect your private key while it's stored on the hard drive.
    
      $ ls -al ~/.ssh
    # Checks for existing SSH keys on your computer and lists the files in your .ssh directory.
    
4) Add your key to the ssh-agent:
    # ssh-agent provides a secure way of storing the private key. For private keys that require a passphrase, 
    # allows the user to connect multiple times without having to repeatedly type the passphrase.
      
      $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    # starts the ssh-agent in the background.
      
      $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    # Adds your generated SSH key to the ssh-agent.
